Title: XARC user API (C++)
See also: <xarc.hpp>


Section: Getting Started
*Using the ExtractArchive object*

Each archive that you want to work with in XARC is represented by an object
descended from the <Archive> class.
 - <ExtractArchive> - Represents an archive opened for reading and extracting.

You can construct an uninitialized <ExtractArchive> with the default
constructor, or open an archive file right away.
 - <ExtractArchive::ExtractArchive> - Constructors.
 - <Archive::IsOkay> - Check if an archive was opened successfully.

Once an <ExtractArchive> object is opened successfully, the first entry (file or
directory) in the archive is available to be examined and extracted.
 - <ExtractArchive::GetItemInfo> - Gets the associated metadata of the current
     entry, i.e. whether it is a file or directory, what its relative path is
     within the archive, what its modification timestamp is, etc.
 - <ExtractArchive::ExtractItem> - Extract the current entry from the archive to
     the filesystem.

You can seek through the archive one entry at a time. Seeking only happens in
the forward direction; once you've reached the last entry, you must destroy the
<ExtractArchive> object.
 - <ExtractArchive::NextItem> - Move to the next entry in the archive.


Section: Handling Errors
*Return codes, error strings and exceptions*

Methods in the <Archive> class and its descendants may throw exceptions when
uncommon errors occur.
 - <XarcException> - The XARC exception class.

However, most XARC C++ methods (including constructors) don't necessarily throw
exceptions themselves, but instead will mark the archive object as being in an
errored state. These methods return <xarc_result_t> codes just like the
functions in the C API.
 - <XARC result codes> - All possible XARC API return codes.

The <Archive> object also stores information about the most recent error, so
you don't necessarily have to process an error at the point of return from the
XARC method.
 - <Archive::IsOkay> - Check if any error has occurred for the <Archive> object.
 - <Archive::GetXarcErrorID> - Get the result code for the most recent occurring
     error in the <Archive> object.
 - <Archive::GetLibraryErrorID> - Get the result code returned by a library that
     XARC uses, such as ZLIB.

XARC can also provide user-friendly strings describing the error.
 - <Archive::GetErrorDescription> - Get a string describing the type of error
     that has occurred.
 - <Archive::GetErrorAdditional> - Get a string containing any specific
     information about the error.
